# Aviator Demonstration
A demonstration of a considered "safe" strategy for the real-money betting game named "Aviator".

In the Aviator, you take on the role of a daring pilot. Your earnings are based on how high you can fly the plane. The higher you fly, the greater your winnings will be. Don’t press the cashout button too early, or you will miss out on potential earnings. The goal is to time hitting the button perfectly to maximize your winnings. You lose all your money if you don’t cash out your bet before the plane leaves. However, if you are reasonable and only multiply the rate by 2-3 times, then success is practically guaranteed!

The strategy consists in cashing out when the plane has reached 1.20x, and this is repeated in every round.
For some, this strategy sounds bad, but for others it sounds like a really good tactic.

That's why I made this script in Python. On running, you only need to input the bet size and have the `values.txt` file filled with random values(collected from the game Aviator).

By default, the success rate for the values introduced by me in the `values.txt` file is 74%.
